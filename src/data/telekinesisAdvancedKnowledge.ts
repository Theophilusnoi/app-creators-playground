  // Hindu and Buddhist Foundations
  {
    id: 'hindu-siddhis-overview',
    category: 'Hindu Traditions',
    title: 'Hindu Siddhis and Spiritual Development',
    content: `In Hindu philosophy, the development of siddhis is understood as a natural byproduct of spiritual advancement rather than an end goal in itself. The ancient texts describe specific meditation techniques, breathing practices, and ethical preparations necessary for safely developing these abilities. The tradition emphasizes that attempting to develop siddhis without proper spiritual foundation and ethical grounding can lead to spiritual imbalance and potential harm.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Develop spiritual practices (meditation, ethics, pranayama) before focusing on specific abilities.',
    ancientWisdom: 'Siddhis arise naturally through spiritual purification rather than forced development.',
    modernContext: 'Holistic approach to consciousness development supported by modern neuroscience research.',
    safetyNotes: 'Always maintain ethical foundation and spiritual balance throughout development.',
    tradition: 'Hindu'
  },
  {
    id: 'buddhist-riddhi-classification',
    category: 'Buddhist Traditions', 
    title: 'Buddhist Classification of Riddhis',
    content: `Buddhist catalogues of siddhis provide exhaustive classifications of different types of consciousness-based abilities, including various forms of telekinesis. These catalogues describe not only the abilities themselves but the specific meditation practices, mental preparations, and ethical requirements necessary for their development. The Buddhist approach emphasizes the importance of developing these abilities within the context of compassion and wisdom, warning against their use for personal gain or ego enhancement.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Study traditional classifications to understand different types of telekinetic abilities.',
    ancientWisdom: 'Abilities should be developed within framework of compassion and wisdom.',
    modernContext: 'Systematic approach to ability development with built-in ethical safeguards.',
    safetyNotes: 'Avoid using abilities for personal gain or ego enhancement.',
    tradition: 'Buddhist'
  },
  {
    id: 'buddhist-mind-matter-relationship',
    category: 'Buddhist Traditions',
    title: 'Buddhist Understanding of Mind-Matter Interaction',
    content: `The Buddhist understanding of telekinesis is grounded in their sophisticated analysis of the relationship between mind and matter. According to Buddhist philosophy, what we perceive as solid matter is actually a dynamic interplay of energy and consciousness. Through proper meditation and understanding, practitioners can learn to influence this interplay directly, resulting in what appears to external observers as telekinetic phenomena.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Develop understanding of mind-matter relationship through meditation and philosophical study.',
    ancientWisdom: 'Matter is dynamic interplay of energy and consciousness, not solid substance.',
    modernContext: 'Aligns with quantum physics understanding of matter as energy patterns.',
    tradition: 'Buddhist'
  },
  {
    id: 'graduated-development-approach',
    category: 'Hindu Traditions',
    title: 'Graduated Development and Proper Guidance',
    content: `Both Hindu and Buddhist traditions emphasize the importance of developing these abilities gradually and under proper guidance. They describe specific stages of development, warning signs of imbalance, and methods for maintaining spiritual equilibrium throughout the process. These traditions also stress that the ultimate goal is not the development of extraordinary abilities but the realization of the fundamental unity between consciousness and all manifestation.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Seek qualified guidance and follow systematic stages of development.',
    ancientWisdom: 'Ultimate goal is realization of consciousness-manifestation unity, not abilities themselves.',
    modernContext: 'Staged development approach validated by modern learning psychology.',
    safetyNotes: 'Monitor for warning signs of imbalance; maintain spiritual equilibrium.',
    tradition: 'Hindu/Buddhist'
  },
  {
    id: 'common-principles-synthesis',
    category: 'Universal Principles',
    title: 'Common Principles Across Ancient Traditions',
    content: `Despite their diverse cultural contexts, ancient traditions share remarkable similarities in their understanding of consciousness-based influence over physical reality. All emphasize the fundamental interconnectedness of all existence, suggesting that the apparent separation between mind and matter is more a limitation of ordinary perception than an absolute reality. These traditions consistently emphasize the importance of ethical preparation, suggesting that the development of telekinetic abilities without corresponding spiritual and moral development can lead to imbalance and potential harm.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Apply universal principles: interconnectedness awareness, ethical preparation, gradual development.',
    ancientWisdom: 'Separation between mind and matter is perceptual limitation, not absolute reality.',
    modernContext: 'Cross-cultural convergence suggests universal principles governing consciousness-matter interaction.',
    safetyNotes: 'Ethical and spiritual development must parallel ability development.'
  },
  {
    id: 'universal-practice-elements',
    category: 'Universal Principles',
    title: 'Universal Elements in Traditional Practices',
    content: `The practices described across these traditions share common elements including specific breathing techniques, visualization methods, energy awareness exercises, and ethical guidelines. This convergence suggests that despite cultural differences, these traditions may have discovered universal principles governing the relationship between consciousness and physical reality. Understanding these historical foundations provides contemporary practitioners with valuable perspective on their own development.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Incorporate universal elements: breath work, visualization, energy awareness, ethics.',
    ancientWisdom: 'Common practices across cultures suggest universal consciousness-matter principles.',
    modernContext: 'Cross-cultural validation provides strong foundation for modern practice.',
    tradition: 'Universal'

  // Scientific Perspective and Energy Principles
  {
    id: 'quantum-matter-energy-relationship',
    category: 'Scientific Perspective',
    title: 'Quantum Nature of Matter and Energy',
    content: `Modern physics has revealed that what we perceive as solid matter is actually composed of atoms and subatomic particles in constant motion. At the quantum level, the distinction between matter and energy becomes increasingly blurred, with particles existing in states of probability rather than fixed positions. This understanding aligns remarkably with ancient spiritual traditions that have long maintained that physical reality is far more fluid and responsive to consciousness than ordinary perception suggests.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Understand matter as energy patterns rather than solid objects when practicing.',
    modernContext: 'Quantum physics supports fluidity of matter-energy relationship.',
    ancientWisdom: 'Ancient traditions understood matter as responsive to consciousness.',
    safetyNotes: 'Work with energy patterns rather than forcing solid objects.'
  },
  {
    id: 'vibrational-frequency-principles',
    category: 'Scientific Perspective',
    title: 'Vibrational Patterns and Frequency',
    content: `Everything in the universe, including human beings, exists as patterns of energy vibrating at specific frequencies. The particular pattern and speed of these vibrations determine how objects appear to our senses and their apparent physical properties. From this perspective, telekinesis might be understood as the ability to influence these vibrational patterns through focused consciousness, thereby altering the physical properties or behavior of objects.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Focus on influencing vibrational frequencies rather than physical force.',
    modernContext: 'Everything exists as vibrational energy patterns at quantum level.',
    ancientWisdom: 'Traditional practices recognized vibrational nature of reality.',
    safetyNotes: 'Work with natural frequency changes rather than forced alterations.'
  },
  {
    id: 'consciousness-observer-effect',
    category: 'Scientific Perspective',
    title: 'The Observer Effect and Consciousness',
    content: `Quantum physics has demonstrated that the act of observation can influence the behavior of subatomic particles, suggesting a fundamental connection between consciousness and physical reality. While the implications of this observer effect for macroscopic telekinesis remain speculative, it provides a theoretical framework for understanding how focused awareness might influence physical phenomena.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Practice conscious observation as active influence rather than passive watching.',
    modernContext: 'Observer effect in quantum mechanics suggests consciousness-matter interaction.',
    safetyNotes: 'Maintain clear intention and focused awareness during practice.'
  },
  {
    id: 'biofield-electromagnetic-interface',
    category: 'Scientific Perspective',
    title: 'Biofield and Electromagnetic Interactions',
    content: `The human body generates measurable electromagnetic fields through neural activity, heart rhythm, and cellular processes. Some researchers theorize that telekinetic effects might occur through the interaction of these biofields with the electromagnetic properties of objects. While definitive proof remains elusive, this provides a potential mechanism for consciousness-based influence over physical matter.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Develop awareness and control of personal biofield through energy practices.',
    modernContext: 'Biofield research provides potential mechanism for telekinetic effects.',
    safetyNotes: 'Maintain biofield balance through grounding and energy circulation practices.'
  },
  {
    id: 'morphic-field-theory',
    category: 'Scientific Perspective',
    title: 'Morphic Fields and Information Transfer',
    content: `Biologist Rupert Sheldrake's theory of morphic fields suggests that patterns of organization are maintained and transmitted through non-physical fields. This theory proposes that consciousness might access and influence these organizing fields, potentially explaining how mental intention could affect physical objects without direct physical contact.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Work with organizing patterns and fields rather than individual objects.',
    modernContext: 'Morphic field theory provides framework for non-local consciousness effects.',
    safetyNotes: 'Focus on harmonious field interactions rather than forceful manipulation.'
  },
  {
    id: 'coherence-entrainment-principles',
    category: 'Scientific Perspective',
    title: 'Coherence and Entrainment Effects',
    content: `Scientific research on coherence states shows that focused attention and intention can create measurable changes in physiological and electromagnetic coherence. The principle of entrainment suggests that coherent systems can influence less coherent systems to adopt similar patterns. These principles may explain how a highly coherent mental state could influence the behavior of physical objects.`,
    practicalApplication: 'Develop internal coherence through meditation and focused attention practices.',
    modernContext: 'Coherence research validates importance of mental state in influence work.',
    safetyNotes: 'Maintain physiological and mental coherence to avoid system strain.'
